# Tree Map

In this project I create a tree map to display the top 100 Highest grossing movies grouped by genre.
This project is from the freeCodeCamp course, and it's made with D3.js library.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/tree-map.git
```

Go inside the **tree-map** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at this app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/tree-map/).


## Main features

* In this project I used D3.js version 5.
* You can mouse hover an area of the map (each area corresponds to a specific movie) and see a tooltip which displays more information about that specific movie.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
